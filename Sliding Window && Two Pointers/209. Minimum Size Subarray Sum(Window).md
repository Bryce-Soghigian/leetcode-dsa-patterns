# Approaches
## Problem #209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum
### I will be covering the following approaches 

- 1. Brute Force
- 2. Sliding Window


## Approach 1. Brute Force(TLE)

### Intuition
The primary concept here is that we  can just generate all of the subarrays and see of those who equal target, have the smallest length. Its a very basic algorithm but also very slow. I think covering the brute force can be important for defining some bigger steps of our algorithm however so we will still cover it. 

#### Breakdown Of Algorithm
1. Check for our edgecases and possible O(1) solutions to the problem. (Reusable for Sliding Window Approach)
2.  Define our variables that we will use to count the smallest window
3.  Our Brute force that uses double for loops to generate the sum of all subarrays
4.  return minimum if valid else return 0
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if nums == None or len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        if nums[0] >= target:
            return 1

        minimum = float("inf")
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            subarray_sum = 0
            for j in range(i,len(nums)):
                subarray_sum += nums[j]
                if j - i < minimum and subarray_sum == target:
                    minimum = j - i + 1
                
        if minimum == float("inf"):
            return 0
        else:
            return minimum

```


## Approach 2. Sliding Window

### Intuition

The idea here is that we can take two pointers and create a window, and keep track of the sum of that window. We also want to find which of these windows is the smallest that is also equal to our target number.

#### Breakdown of algorithm

1. Check for edgecases like if we have an empty array or arent provided one
2. Declare all of our pointers (start, end, window_sum, minimum)
3. Iterate through list while our start pointer hasn't reached the end
3a. check to see if our window sum is less than our target sum. If it is we want to increase our window sum and move forward our end pointer
3b. inner while loop that moves forward our start pointer while our window_sum is greater than or equal to target. We want to check if our current window is smaller than our minimum each iteration and move forward our start pointer

4. We now will have looped through the entire array. Lets check to make sure we found a valid window. If we did return the smallest window. Else return 0

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if nums == None or len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        if nums[0] >= target:
            return 1
        
        start = 0
        end = 0 
        window_sum = 0
        minimum = 10 ** 10000
        
        while end < len(nums):
            if window_sum < target:
                window_sum += nums[end]
                end += 1
            while window_sum >= target:
                if end - start < minimum:
                    minimum = end - start
                window_sum -= nums[start]
                start += 1
                
        if minimum == 10 ** 10000:
            return 0
        else:
            return minimum
```
