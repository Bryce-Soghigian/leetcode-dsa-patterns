# leetcode-dsa-patterns
The purpose of this project is to put together a guide on each important data structure or algorithms concept and break down all of the subconcepts. So you have one place to get exposed to every single major pattern, while also then going though and solving questions on that pattern

### PSA
- I will be showing examples with javascript and write my solutions in javascript and python. If you want to contribute some java, c++ or some other languages implementation, please just write a pull request

## Hashtables and Sets
- These are useful for counting frequency or keeping track of some value . BOth are OP
### Subcategories TBD


## Linked Lists
- I will be going over both SLLs and DLL as well as all of the common algorithmic patterns associated with those types of problems.
### Subcategories Of Linked List Problems/ Useful Patterns

- Inserting, deleting and modifying the linked list in place
- Sentinel Node Pattern
- Slow and Fast Pointers
- Prev and Curr Pointers
- Reversing SLL and DLL(can do with some of the previous strategem )


## Two Pointers
- The LL section covers some awesome two pointers strategem but we want to make use of the many more patterns that involve the two pointers

- Sliding Window
- Pairs

## Trees (Binary/N-ary)
- We will only get into those two basic types of trees. No interviewer in their right mind will expect you to build out red-black/ self balancing trees during an interview . We will go over tree traversals and common patterns

- Will be basing this section off of https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1212004/Binary-Trees-study-guide
### Subcategories Of Tree problems
#### DFS
- Understanding recursion and the call stack
- Stacks
- Inorder
- Preorder
- Postorder

#### BFS
- Intro to queues
- Level Order Traversal

#### Morris :)
- Using Morris Traversal to traverse tree :) 

#### Other Tree Patterns
- Paths(Root to leaf or just in general)
- Tree Validation
- Tree Construction 
- BST problems. Taking advantage of a binary tree being a binary search tree


#### Special Trees
- Tries(Covered later)
- Cartesian Coordinate Tree
- Segment Trees
- Treaps

## Tries (Prefix and Suffix)
- This is a more rare variety of problem but will offer some awesome string searching solutions. We will go over basic implementation of tries 
- Alternate Leetcode Study Guide



## Heaps
- Useful bois. Heaps are useful for k elements or max or min problems
### Heap Subcategories
- MinHeap()
- MaxHeap()
- Kth Element
- Merge Intervals

## Graphs
- graphs are useful for relational data like networks where the data is all related in some way

### Graph Patterns/ Algorithms
- Representing Graphs
- Directed vs Unweighted
- Acylic CS Cyclic Graphs
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Union Find 
- Detecting Cycles
- Indegree Outdegree
- Graph Coloring
- Topological Sorting
- Shortest Path weighted(Dijksta's/Bellman Ford)
#### Going over common graph classes
- Forbidden subgraphs
- Planar Graphs
- Bipartite Graphs
- Interval Graphs
- Circular Graphs



## Bit Manipulation

## Dynamic Programming 
- FUCK this is not my favorite category and one I want to improve at. Hopefully this patterns repo makes me better at dp
